[Captioned Scenes](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/i1760f3KXz9lHjvkUEgxoXpUTni2J6cf_DVEEH75IlQ)
>For this project, Mayank and I created a halloween scene with a color & position changing pumpkin and a dancing skeleton. These two characters are speaking in the scene.

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/obu6p5uFlzh8f7YIQveOQKP2frqsxySBXbRBvy-w9WM)
>For this project, Zena, Mayank and I created a welcome home card with a dancing alien that changes colors, as well balloons and an UFO that are both controlled by the arrow keys.

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/1Hghqu0d0Zz9qREVODH2PdRutG2h4bdhiKJNE90LBvU)
>For this project, Zena, Mayank and I each split up our code into separate parts, with each one of doing a bit and then consolidating it at the end. We creaked a remake of the dino game with 3 lives.

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/H6d9nX8Y-qUV1BdCEM6UqbOzzCGKfplq623rORCG-nM)
>For this project, Zena, Mayank and I worked on different componenets, and were able to integrate our different ideas, such as the lightning bolt, the changing direction of the birds, and the lightning bolts.

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/4BfzGfmfw-7hyMQVzlHPvSxF-sSARLbY6wg1HzNvMLQ)
>For this project, I came up with a cool theme of space and added on to it, leaning into the retro vibe and having the 'static,' and I added multiple lives as well, where the player(spaceship) would reset itself.

[Final Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/8wAURYPB1TyzYQ0nbptwoMUHrWmBZjK15FswEbc_8cY)
>For this project, I had a lot of trial and error, and I ended up doing a lot of manipulatng of the photos to fit the window. One fun feature are the "covers" which give the backgrounds more of a 3D effect as the cart passes behind them but in front of the background.

<h2>MIT App Inventor</h2>	

[Hello It's Me](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=31cdeb1b-8641-45c4-acc6-e174757bb247)
>For this project, I had a lot of trial and error, and I ended up with a fun setup with four animals and a label that switches between "mystery" and the animal name

[Music Maker](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=4c181f5e-14f8-4ca7-9cd8-98915f45d8df)
>For this project, I spent a lot of time trying to format the buttons. Eventually, I learnt that I needed to change my strategy, and I was able to then fix my project. 

[Food Chase](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=b612d960-29f4-416e-8bcd-41a409882005)
>For this project, I read through the directions and then copied all of the code and then modified it to get rid of the parts i didn't need and added in some new blocks to make the game work according to the rubric requirements.
