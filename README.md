>For this project, Mayank and I created a halloween scene with a color & position changing pumpkin and a dancing skeleton. These two characters are speaking in the scene.

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/obu6p5uFlzh8f7YIQveOQKP2frqsxySBXbRBvy-w9WM)
>For this project, Zena, Mayank and I created a welcome home card with a dancing alien that changes colors, as well balloons and an UFO that are both controlled by the arrow keys.

>For this project, Zena, Mayank and I each split up our code into separate parts, with each one of doing a bit and then consolidating it at the end. We creaked a remake of the dino game with 3 lives.

>For this project, Zena, Mayank and I worked on different componenets, and were able to integrate our different ideas, such as the lightning bolt, the changing direction of the birds, and the lightning bolts.

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/4BfzGfmfw-7hyMQVzlHPvSxF-sSARLbY6wg1HzNvMLQ)
>For this project, I came up with a cool theme of space and added on to it, leaning into the retro vibe and having the 'static,' and I added multiple lives as well, where the player(spaceship) would reset itself.

[Final Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/8wAURYPB1TyzYQ0nbptwoMUHrWmBZjK15FswEbc_8cY)
>For this project, I had a lot of trial and error, and I anded up doing a lot of manipulatng of the photos to fit the window. One fun feature are the "covers" which give the backgrounds more of a 3D effect as the cart passes behind them but in front of the background.
